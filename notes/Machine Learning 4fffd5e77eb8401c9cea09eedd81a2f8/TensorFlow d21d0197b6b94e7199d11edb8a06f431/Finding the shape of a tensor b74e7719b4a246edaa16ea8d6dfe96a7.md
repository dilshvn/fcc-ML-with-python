# Finding the shape of a tensor

```jsx
rank2_tensor.shape
```

Here, shape of rank2_tensor is (2, 2). Here, we have 2 numbers because this is a rank 2 tensor.

This means there are 2 items inside and each of those items also have 2 items inside

(3, 4, 2) means there are 3 items and they have 4 items each which has 2 items each. Here, we have 3 numbers because this is a rank 3 tensor.

Items of same level should have same number of items each

Shape of a rank 0 tensor is ()
