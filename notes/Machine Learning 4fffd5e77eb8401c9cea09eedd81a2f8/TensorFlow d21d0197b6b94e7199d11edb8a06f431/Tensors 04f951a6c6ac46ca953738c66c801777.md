# Tensors

TensorFlow represents tensors as n-dimensional arrays. Tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensions. Vectors can have any number of dimensions

- 1d is a number (scalar)
- 2d is a 2d graph with x and y numbers
- 3d is a graph with x, y and z numbers
- 4d is image data or video data

TensorFlow programs work by building a graph of Tensor objects that details how tensors are related

Tensors have a data type and a shape

- Data types: float32, int32, string, etc
- Shape describes the dimension of data
